This tutorial introduces the basics of writing a RESTful web service API with Go and the Gin Web Framework (Gin).

Youâ€™ll get the most out of this tutorial if you have a basic familiarity with Go and its tooling. If this is your first exposure to Go, please see Tutorial: Get started with Go for a quick introduction.
# Getting Started
```
git clone https://github.com/deepakmardii/go-API
```
Next:
```
cd go-API
```
Install Gin:
```
go get github.com/gin-gonic/gin
```
From the command line in the directory containing main.go, run the code:
```
go run .
```
From a new command line window, use curl to make a GET request to your running web service.
